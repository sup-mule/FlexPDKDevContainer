# VSCode DevContaier for Flex PDK Developemt 

## Prerequisites: 
  - Visual Studio Code
     - Dev Container Extenstion for VSCode 
  - Docker (or Podman)

## How To: 

When a folder with devcontainer setting enabled is opened in VSCode (with devcontainer extension) it'll ask if you want to open it in a container. Hit yes and develop away.

p.s. I made it for my Mac M1 so it's using Ubuntu AMD64 for base image. you can change it to your hardware.
